			<tr> <th>Frame Model</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Price</th></tr>
			
			<tr> <td><a href="https://dariopegoretti.com/product/round/" target="_blank">Round</a></td> <td>Round, our latest frame, came to life over long lunches in the Bottega, and even longer deliberations by the espresso machine about its place in the Pegoretti line-up.<br><br>For some time, the Pegoretti community has been asking us to take the exceptional performance of the Mxxxxxo and develop a new model in stainless steel. Round is our response: an incredibly reactive frame built for the rider seeking a no-compromise steel speed machine.<br><br>Round blends bespoke Columbus XCR tubing with 3D printed stainless steel dropouts (a first on a Pegoretti), and a new rear triangle and brake bridge design that affords superior lateral stiffness and responsiveness.<br><br>Named in honour of the sign-off handle for which company founder, Dario Pegoretti was known to friends and customers alike, Round features an original graphic called Texas Flood, inspired by Darios love for the music of Stevie Ray Vaughan, the city of Austin, Texas and a certain colourful cowboy belt brought back from that same city.</td> <td>$5899.99</td></tr>
			
			<tr> <td><a href="https://dariopegoretti.com/product/responsorium/" target="_blank">Responsorium</a></td> <td>The Respo is one of our most popular frames because it does so many things well. Its fast, exceptionally comfortable and thanks to its stainless steel construction, a natural choice for challenging environments.<br><br>The Responsorium blends custom drawn Columbus XCR steel with Pegoretti signature hooded dropouts and 16mm cylindrical non-tapering stays. Coupled with its thinner walls and more extensive butting, the Responsorium affords a touch more vertical compliance than our other frames, making it a great choice for very long days in the saddle.<br><br>The Responsorium is named after an album by Argentine musician, Dino Saluzzi.</td> <td>$5549.99</td></tr>
			
			<tr> <td><a href="https://dariopegoretti.com/product/mxxxxxo/" target="_blank">Marcelo or MXXXXXO</a></td> <td>The Mxxxxxo is an excellent choice for stronger riders, larger riders and those who prize stiffness and responsiveness. Naturally, the Mxxxxxo is also a comfortable ride, but it does give up some of that comfort to the Responsorium.<br><br>The Mxxxxxo is constructed of heat-treated Columbus Niobium Spirit tubing. The front triangle using the same tubing diameters as the Responsorium, whereas the rear triangle has slightly larger cylindrical seat stays, which give a touch more stiffness and responsiveness to the ride. The Mxxxxxo also uses Pegoretti hooded dropouts and a D11 headset.</td> <td>$4299.99</td></tr>
			
			<tr> <td><a href="https://dariopegoretti.com/product/duende/" target="_blank">Duende</a></td> <td>The Duende is a little closer to a traditional frame than our other models. But as shown here, its also available in a CX configuration for cyclocross riders.<br><br>Like the Mxxxxxo, the Duende is constructed with Columbus Niobium Spirit tubing, albeit without the heat-treatment. The rear triangle also features more traditional tapering stays and more conventional dropouts.<br><br>While not quite as stiff as the Round, Mxxxxxo or Responsorium, Duende is well suited for someone seeking a comfortable all-day bike that does everything well. The tubing is still oversized in comparison with traditional steel tube sets.</td> <td>$3649.99</td></tr>
			
			<tr> <td><a href="https://dariopegoretti.com/product/luigino/" target="_blank">Luigino</a></td> <td>The Luigino represents our interpretation of the classic Italian race bicycle from cyclings halcyon past.

			<tr> <td><a href="https://dariopegoretti.com/product/day-is-done/" target="_blank">Day is Done</a></td> <td>For those who want an oversized lugged frame, there is the Day Is Done. This frame uses a 1-1/8 headset, oversized tubing and features non-tapering stays which culminate in a unique dropout designed just for this frame.<br><br>The name Day Is Done comes from a Nick Drake song, as covered by the jazz pianist Brad Mehldau.</td> <td>$6549.99</td></tr>
			
			<tr> <td><a href="https://dariopegoretti.com/product/big-leg-emma/" target="_blank">Big Leg Emma</a></td> <td>At the extreme end of stiffness and responsiveness, is the Big Leg Emma. This frame shares the front triangle of the Mxxxxxo but features reinforcing plates brazed inside the downtube for additional stiffness. The chainstays are massive (thus the name) and help create an amazingly stiff frame while retaining as much comfort as possible. This is a great frame for very large and/or very strong riders and especially those who love to sprint.</td> <td>$5569.99</td></tr>
			
			<tr> <td><a href="https://dariopegoretti.com/product/love-3/" target="_blank">Love #3</a></td> <td>First launched in 2006, Love #3 became an instant classic, with riders falling for its fast, fun, and predictable handling. It was an aluminium frame unlike any other: aggressive and smooth. A punk rocker with good manners.<br><br>New Love #3 respects the originals killer feel, but boasts a larger diameter headtube of 43mm, up from 39mm on the original. The new headtube is stiffer and blends better with the rest of the frames custom, over-sized Columbus Alloy tubing. But with a 4mm advantage over the original Love #3, the redesigned headtube required an entirely new headset, the Chris King D19.<br><br>D19 is a customised version of the popular Chris King sealed bearing NoThreadSet. The new headset is a result of Chris King & Pegorettis ongoing partnership and builds on both brands long history of cooperation and innovation.<br><br>New Love #3 starts shipping fall/winter 2020, in all paint options, including Ciavete.
